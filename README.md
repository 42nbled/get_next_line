# get_next_line

One of my first project at 42.
The goal of this project is to implement a function that allows reading a file line-by-line from a given file descriptor (e.g., a file, stdin) in a controlled and efficient manner. This project is an exercise in understanding memory management, file reading, and handling edge cases while adhering to strict constraints.
